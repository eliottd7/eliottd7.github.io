## Aesthetics ##

### 1. Visual concept ###

Main objective: arcade game like boss galaga. 
- mouse pointer is fighter jet ship near bottom of screen
  - tracks mouse X position only, or jumps to finger tap X position
  - click to shoot
  - hitting a target equivalent to clicking on it
    - ship hit is destroyed, others fly off, then new ships "tug" new page across onto screen
    - if the ship is an arrow ship, then ship hit is destroyed and others fly off in OPPOSITE direction and new ones fly in
      - ex: right arrow ship hit, explodes --> all ships fly towards the left
